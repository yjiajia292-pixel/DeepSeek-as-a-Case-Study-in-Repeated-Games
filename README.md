DeepSeek as a Case Study in Repeated Games: Micro-Level Analysis of Decision Trajectories and Reasoning
DeepSeek in Repeated Games: Micro-Level Analysis of Decision Trajectories
1. Key Parameter Definitions
Parameter	Description
m&o	Prompt includes both the opponents and my (self) historical actions.
o	Prompt includes only the opponents historical actions.
1 (memory length)	Only the previous rounds actions are provided in the prompt.
all (memory length)	All previous rounds actions are provided in the prompt.
2. File Naming Convention & Experiment Mapping
All code files follow a unified naming format. You can directly identify the experimental conditions from the filename:
{strategy_type}_{noise_level}_{memory_length}_{prompt_info}.py
2.1 Experiment File Reference Table
Experiment Purpose	Example File(s)	Core Conditions Explained
Exp 1: Effect of Noise under Short Memory	single_0.01_1_m&o.py single_0.05_1_m&o.py single_0.10_1_m&o.py	Variable: Noise Level (0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1) Fixed: M=1, prompt=m&o
Exp 2: Effect of Memory Length	single_0.00_all_m&o.py single_0.01_all_m&o.py single_0.00_1_o.py	Variables: Memory Length (1, all) & Prompt Info (m&o, o) Context: Compared across different noise levels.
3. Quick Start: How to Run the Code
3.1 Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required packages (e.g., requests for API calls if applicable). You may need to install them first:
pip install requests  # Or any other required package from your ‘requirements.txt‘
3.2 Running a Specific Experiment
To replicate a specific experimental condition, simply run the corresponding Python file from your terminal or command line.
Example: Run the experiment with noise=0.01, short memory (M=1), and full history prompt (m&o)
python single_0.01_1_m&o.py
Example: Run the experiment with no noise, full memory (M=all), and full history prompt (m&o)
python single_0.00_all_m&o.py
3.3 Expected Output
Each script is self-contained and will:
1.Execute the iterative prisoners dilemma game for the specified condition.
2.Log process information (e.g., round-by-round actions, reasoning text if captured) to the console or a designated log file.
3.Calculate and print summary statistics (e.g., final cooperation rate) at the end.
4. Data and Citation
The raw data generated by running these scripts (e.g., action trajectories, calculated cooperation rates) is typically saved in the same directory or in a dedicated ./data/ folder. If you use this code or data in your work, please cite our associated paper.
